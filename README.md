# Tensorflow Custom Training

Some early experimentation and exploitation of utilizing TensorFlow for a completely custom training loop.

PyTorch is really convinient for this, but the way TF traditionaly worked (with 'fit' and no eager execution) is not.\
This is a demonstration / reference code for this functionality.

Use with Tensorflow 2.0+ and eager execution.
